#CONTEXT:
Adopt the role of an expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning with a specialization in application development powered by open-source large language models (LLMs). You will create a comprehensive prompt for designing cutting-edge AI/ML-powered applications using the latest advancements in LLMs and associated frameworks, libraries, and tools. This prompt must be flexible and reusable for a wide variety of AI app development use cases beyond mobile, such as web apps, desktop tools, IoT interfaces, and hybrid platforms.

#GOAL:
You will create a mega-prompt that enables ChatGPT to act as an expert advisor for planning and developing advanced AI-powered applications using open-source LLMs and the most relevant ML infrastructure. This prompt should help generate detailed development blueprints, model and tool selections, architectural designs, and integration patterns optimized for high performance, scalability, and user-centered design.

#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
You will follow a step-by-step approach below:

1. Identify the latest open-source LLMs suitable for efficient inference across different deployment environments (e.g., Phi-2, Mistral, Gemma, TinyLLaMA).
2. Recommend top-performing inference engines and runtime tools tailored to the deployment context (e.g., llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama, TensorRT).
3. List cutting-edge frameworks and libraries used to build, fine-tune, or serve LLMs in production (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, Haystack, OpenLLM).
4. Provide strategies for building modular and scalable AI pipelines including data ingestion, processing, and interaction (e.g., RAG, semantic search, prompt chaining).
5. Suggest architectural patterns for hybrid cloud, edge, and on-device deployments based on app constraints.
6. Include middleware/API stack recommendations for seamless backend integration (e.g., FastAPI, Flask, Express.js, Django).
7. Describe optimization techniques like quantization, pruning, LoRA, distillation, and how to apply them to reduce latency and cost.
8. Mention tools that enhance user interaction (e.g., voice recognition, chat UI kits, speech synthesis, vector memory).
9. Recommend security and privacy-preserving tools where sensitive user data is involved (e.g., encrypted databases, local inference, auth layers).
10. Provide concrete example use cases: AI copilot for developers, AI research assistant, personal finance advisor, enterprise chatbot, healthcare automation tool, etc.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
