# Performance Optimization

## Frontend (Flutter Web & Mobile)
- **Code Splitting:** Preloads only required modules on navigation
- **Lazy Loading:** Screens and components loaded on demand
- **List Virtualization:** `ListView.builder` for efficient rendering of long lists
- **Asset Optimization:** SVGs used when possible, and image assets compressed
- **Build Optimization:** Tree shaking and minification for web builds

## Backend (Supabase Edge Functions)
- **Cold Start Mitigation:** Supabase keeps warm containers for active routes
- **Efficient Queries:** Indexed fields on `tasks.updated_at`, `calendar.timestamp`
- **Rate Limiting:** Edge Functions use Supabase's built-in rate limiting

## API Optimization
- **Payload Minimization:** Only essential fields returned in responses
- **Pagination:** Task and calendar endpoints return paginated data (`limit`/`offset`)
- **Batch Updates:** Sync APIs accept array mutations to reduce HTTP overhead

## Sync Engine
- Uses differential sync by comparing `lastSyncedAt` timestamps
- Minimizes bandwidth and avoids full resync unless drift detected

## Mobile-Specific Optimizations

### Rendering Performance
- Use `const` constructors for static widgets
- Implement widget memoization for expensive builds
- Use `RepaintBoundary` to isolate repaints
- Reduce overdraw with optimized widget trees

### Memory Management
- Implement image caching with size limits
- Dispose controllers and subscriptions
- Lazily load large data sets
- Use memory-efficient collections

### Network Optimization
- Implement request debouncing and throttling
- Use HTTP/2 for multiplexed connections
- Cache API responses with appropriate TTLs
- Compress request/response payloads

### Battery Efficiency
- Batch background operations
- Use workmanager for scheduled tasks
- Optimize location services usage
- Implement adaptive polling based on battery level

## Flutter Web Optimizations
- Use `dart2js` optimization flags
- Cache static assets with appropriate headers
- Lazy load heavy UI components
- Implement route-based code splitting

## Monitoring & Profiling
- Use Flutter DevTools for performance profiling
- Implement custom performance traces
- Monitor cold start and render times
- Track frame rendering performance (fps)
- Capture performance metrics for critical user journeys
