# AI Secretary Mobile App Architecture

## Overview

The AI Secretary is a mobile productivity assistant that helps users manage daily tasks, calendar events, reminders, and communication using natural language. This document outlines the architecture for implementing this application with LangGraph as the orchestration layer.

## Architectural Goals

1. **Privacy-First**: Prioritize on-device processing where possible
2. **Offline Capability**: Core features function without internet access
3. **Extensibility**: Easy integration of new tools and features
4. **Responsiveness**: Fast, fluid user experience
5. **Cross-Platform**: Support for both iOS and Android from a single codebase

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend Layer (Flutter)

The mobile application is built using Flutter for cross-platform support with:

- **UI Components**:
  - Dashboard for prioritized tasks and agenda
  - Smart Inbox for email summaries
  - Calendar View with natural language event creation
  - Voice Interface with push-to-talk capabilities
  - Settings & Personalization screens

- **State Management**:
  - Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
  - Persistent storage for offline capability
  - Synchronization with backend when connectivity is available

- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - Material Design 3 (Material You) for dynamic theming
  - Responsive layouts for various device sizes
  - Platform-specific adaptations where necessary

### 2. Orchestration Layer (LangGraph)

LangGraph serves as the cognitive architecture for the AI Secretary, managing complex workflows and stateful operations:

- **State Management**:
  - `StateGraph` to maintain conversational context
  - Short-term memory for session persistence
  - Long-term memory integration with local and cloud storage

- **Cognitive Flows**:
  - Task Management Graph: creation, prioritization, reminders
  - Calendar Management Graph: event handling, conflicts, scheduling
  - Email Processing Graph: summarization, categorization, action items
  - Voice Interaction Graph: command recognition and routing

- **Tool Integration**:
  - Calendar integration tools
  - Email processing tools
  - Task management tools
  - Device-specific tools (notifications, contacts, etc.)

- **Human-in-the-Loop Capabilities**:
  - Confirmation requests for important actions
  - Suggestion refinement based on user feedback
  - Explainable AI approaches for transparency

### 3. Backend Services

REST API services supporting the mobile application:

- **Authentication Service**:
  - User registration and authentication
  - JWT-based session management
  - OAuth integration for third-party services

- **AI Model Service**:
  - Hosted LLM endpoints for complex reasoning tasks
  - Vector storage for semantic search capabilities
  - Batch processing for resource-intensive operations

- **Sync Service**:
  - Data synchronization between devices
  - Conflict resolution
  - Backup and restore functionality

- **Integration Services**:
  - Email provider connectors
  - Calendar service connectors
  - Task management system connectors

### 4. On-Device Inference

Local processing capabilities to support offline functionality:

- **Whisper.cpp**: Offline speech-to-text processing
- **llama.cpp**: Lightweight LLM for basic NLP tasks
- **MLC LLM**: Mobile-optimized inference for on-device reasoning
- **Local Vector DB**: SQLite-based vector storage for retrieval

### 5. Data Persistence

Strategy for managing user data across the application:

- **Local Storage**:
  - SQLite for structured data
  - Local vector database for embeddings
  - Encrypted file storage for sensitive information

- **Cloud Storage** (Optional):
  - User-controlled sync settings
  - End-to-end encrypted data transfer
  - Configurable retention policies

- **Memory Management**:
  - Conversation history with configurable limits
  - Context summarization for long interactions
  - Prioritized information retention based on relevance

## Implementation Details

### LangGraph Implementation

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, add_messages
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, AIMessage

# Define state structure
class SecretaryState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List, add_messages]
    calendar_events: List
    tasks: List
    email_summaries: List
    context: dict

# Create state graph
secretary_graph = StateGraph(SecretaryState)

# Define nodes for different functionality
def process_user_input(state: SecretaryState):
    # Process and route user input
    return state

def manage_tasks(state: SecretaryState):
    # Handle task-related operations
    return state

def manage_calendar(state: SecretaryState):
    # Handle calendar-related operations
    return state

def process_emails(state: SecretaryState):
    # Handle email-related operations
    return state

def generate_response(state: SecretaryState):
    # Generate appropriate response
    return state

# Add nodes to the graph
secretary_graph.add_node("process_input", process_user_input)
secretary_graph.add_node("tasks", manage_tasks)
secretary_graph.add_node("calendar", manage_calendar)
secretary_graph.add_node("emails", process_emails)
secretary_graph.add_node("response", generate_response)

# Define conditional edges
secretary_graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "process_input",
    lambda state: state["intention"],
    {
        "task": "tasks",
        "calendar": "calendar",
        "email": "emails",
        "general": "response"
    }
)

# Connect remaining nodes
secretary_graph.add_edge("tasks", "response")
secretary_graph.add_edge("calendar", "response")
secretary_graph.add_edge("emails", "response")
secretary_graph.add_edge("response", END)

# Compile the graph
workflow = secretary_graph.compile()
```

### Hybrid Deployment Strategy

1. **On-Device Processing**:
   - Voice recognition using Whisper.cpp
